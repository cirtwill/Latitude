\section*{Introduction}

%Food webs are a thing. (Mention gen, vul, LS.) %Food webs have strong scaling structure.
Food webs (networks of feeding links between species) have been used for decades to summarize the structure of ecological communities \citep{Williams2000,earlierwork}.
One of the earliest goals of constructing food webs was to measure the relationship between the species richness of
a community and its stability \citep{Dunne2006}, a goal which is still pursued today \citep{robustness studies}.
Some authors have recognized the potential for environmental effects to influence stability \citep{Shurin2007}, as well as other food web properties such as food chain length \citep{Townsend1998,Thompson2003,2004c,Young2013,Digel2014}.
Latitude is a particularly intruiging contender for an environmental influence on food web structure \citep{Shurin2007},
as latitudinal gradients in temperature \citep{}, primary productivity \citep{}, body size \citep{}, and 
species richness \citep{Schemske2009a} are among the most robust patterns in ecology[[back up from original draft]]. 


Latitude's strong influence on species richness, however, presents a problem for the analysis of food web structure.
Although it was initially thought that food-web structure was small-world and scale invariant \citep{}, further 
analyses with higher-quality data have revealed that most food-web structural properties scale strongly with species 
richness, connectance (the proportion of possible links that are realized), or both \citep{Riede2010} 
(see \citet{Dunne2006} for a review of the history of scaling laws in food web theory). This means that relationships
between latitude and food-web structure must be considered in light of the latitudinal gradient in species richness.
This is especially true for food-web properties that both scale with species richness and are related to candidate
explanations for the latitudinal diversity gradient.


% Explain niche space hypothesis, Schemske, Vazquez. Then make clear that niche space suggests opposite gradient to ~S^B.
%Then give hypotheses.
Here, we are particularly interested in the potential effects of latitude on scaling relationships for the number of
links per species, generality (the number of prey per predator), and vulnerability (the number of predators per prey).
We focus on these properties because they are related to one of leading candidates for a mechanism behind the 
latitudinal species-richness gradient: namely that species' niches are narrow in the tropics, reducing competition
and permitting greater adaptive radiation (reviewed in \citet{Vazquez2004}). Alternatively, it is  possible that the
higher productivity of the tropics \citep{Brown2004} may result in a broader 
niche space \citep{Davies2007} which could also allow greater diversification even if niche sizes are globally similar.
In either case, if there is less competition at lower latitudes, there should also be less generality. A higher 
proportion of non-competing specialists should also result in lower vulnerability.
Importantly, these trends (lower generality, vulnerability, and hence links per species in the tropics) are opposite
to those based on the positive scaling relationship between links per species and species richness \citep{Riede2010}.
If, therefore, there is a latitudinal effect on generality and vulnerability beyond that of the latitudinal diversity
gradient, the scaling relationships between species richness and links per species, generality, and vulnerability 
should vary over latitude. 



%Among other things, a constant scaling between S and C implies that species tend to eat the same number of prey regarless of diversity \citep{Dunne2006,Pimm1982} - rephrase a bit more, this is very close.



% In addition to species richness, there are general and robust latitudinal gradients in metabolic rates \citep{Stegen2012} and 
% rates and intensities of species interactions \citep{Marquis2005,Schemske2009}. These gradients, together with the strength and 
% generality of associations between biological processes and environmental variables, suggest that variation in network structure 
% may also be explained by ecological gradients \citep{Baiser2012}. Importantly, some of these gradients may act directly 
% on food-web properties such that they change over latitude beyond the expected changes due to changing species richness. For 
% example, if niche sizes vary with latitude then mean numbers of predators, prey, and links per species may also vary with 
% latitude. Some of this variation may be explained by variation in species richness, but as niche sizes are believed to be 
% related directly to latitude it is reasonable to expect that there may also be latitudinal effects unrelated to those of 
% changing species richness.



\section*{Methods}

We compiled a list of 345 food webs from the University of Canberra's GlobalWeb database (www.globalwebdb.com) 
\citep{}. Of these, 302 webs had accessible original sources. 
18 source and sink webs, which describe links to or from a focal taxon, were excluded as they are likely 
to have different food web properties than webs attempting to
describe the entire community of a site \citep{Williams2002}, as were 8 plant-pollinator, 34 host-parasitoid, and 2 
competition-focused networks
\citep{Riede2010}. Of the remaining 230 food webs, we excluded two paleowebs (comprised of probable interactions 
between extinct or prehistoric species) \citep{Simenstad1978} and five ``generalized schemes'' 
\citep{Nybakken1982,Percival1929,Swan1961,Landry1977,Petipa1979,Harrison1963}, as 
we wished to measure
directly observed rather than inferred interactions. We further excluded a food web aggregated from several sites in 
the Pacific Ocean which were widely spread in both latitude and longitude and at markedly different successional stages
\citep{Vinogradov1978}, such that it is not clear which site the food web represents. [[[SI table of rejected webs, and why]]] 
[Explain Thompson, Preston, Amundsen separate from Dunne.]
This left 223 food webs with widely varying levels of taxonomic resolution, 11 of which contained humans. 
We supplemented these networks with the free-living components of eight high-resolution estuarine food webs \citep{Dunne2013,Thompson2005} and two lake food web \citep{Preston2012,Amundsen2013} that 
included parasites, as well as XX webs that have been used in previous studies of food-web scaling. 


Where the latitude of a study site was not 
explicitly stated, latitude was inferred based on Google Earth \citep{} coordinates of the described site.


. We also excluded webs describing highly
modified or artificial ecosystems, and those including humans, as these could also
have different structural properties to more ``natural'' food webs.
Where several food webs were constructed from the same study site, without obvious boundaries between ``sites'' (e.g. three food
webs from Lake Nyasa), we aggregated the webs to form one summary web for the site. That is, we included all species and
interactions observed in any of the the original webs for that site in the summary web.
Similarly, we aggregated food webs created for the same location in different years. Both types of
aggregation should help to combat a known problem with food webs, namely that infrequent interactions and
rare species tend to be under-represented.


We then converted each web to a trophic-species version by aggregating species
with the same predators and prey. This helps to reduce variation in resolution
across different studies.
We then classified them both according to latitude
and ecosystem type (terrestrial, freshwater, marine, or estuary). We then calculated 17
food-web properties for each web (Table \ref{symboltable}).


In our analysis, we first addressed whether the diversity (S) or complexity (C, L/S) of our
published food webs varied over latitude (expressed as degrees away from the
equator regardless of direction) or factorial ecosystem type. We also included
year published as in independent variable to control for changing standards
for food web studies over time. We fit independent generalized linear models
for each of the logarithms of species richness, mean links per species, and
connectance. These models were used to determine any latitudinal gradients in the food-web
properties known to drive scaling relationships with other properties.


Second, we analysed the scaling relationships between the remaining 14 food-
web parameters and connectance and species richness. We used a series of
generalized linear models with a food-web parameter as the dependent variable
and latitude, ecosystem type, and their interactions with connectance and
species richness as independent variables. (parameter ~
latitude*ecotype*(log10(connectance)+log10(species richness))). For food web
properties that were proportions, we used general linear models with a
binomial error distribution. All other food web properties were log-transformed with a normal error distribution.
When modelling the standard deviation of generality, this
required the removal of 5 webs, all with 12 or fewer species, which had
standard deviations of generality of 0. These full models were then
systematically reduced using R function dredge \cite{} in package MuMIn
\cite{} in order to isolate the model with the highest AIC. These best-fitting models were 
then examined in detail. Significant slopes over species-richness or connectance were taken to indicate scaling
relationships. Significant interactions with latitude indicated that these scaling relationships varied from the tropics
to the poles. Different intercepts indicated differences between ecosystem types.


\section*{Results}

In this data set, none of the best fit models for species richness, connectance, or links per species included an 
effect of latitude, although all three properties varied across ecosystem types (Table 2). 


The best-fit models for most food-web properties exhibited scaling relationships with species-richness and/or 
connectance. Notable exceptions were the proportions of basal resources, herbivores, and omnivores, which varied only 
across year published; and the proportions of top predators and intermediate consumers, which varied with connectance 
and species richness and connectance (respectively) although not significantly.


For the food-web properties that did scale with species-richness or connectance, most of these relationships were 
constant over latitude. Latitude terms were not included in the best-fit models for SD of generality or 
SD of links. Best-fit models for vulnerability, SD of vulnerability, and path length included latitude terms but showed 
very weak relationships ($\beta$=3.52 x $10^{-17}$, $p$=0.170; $\beta$=-0.001, $p$=0.050; and $\beta$=0.005, $p$=0.069; 
respectively). None of the above models included an effect of latitude on scaling with S or C.


The scaling rules of mean trophic level and generality, however, did vary over latitude. 
Mean trophic level increased with latitude ($\beta$=0.011, $p$<0.001) and with species richness 
($\beta$=0.633, $p$<0.001), but both trends were weakened by an interaction between latitude and species-richness 
($\beta$=-0.008, $p$=0.001). The best-fitting model for mean trophic 
level did not include a connectance term. The increase in mean trophic level with species richness was highest for 
estuarine food webs ($\beta$=0.633, $p$<0.001) and lower for freshwater ($\beta$=0.259, $p$=0.002), terrestrial 
($\beta$=0.234, $p$=0.005), and marine food webs ($\beta$=0.152, $p$<0.001). For food webs with high species richness, 
trophic level declined with latitude while trophic level in species-poor webs showed the opposite trend 
(Fig. \ref{TL_all}). The number of species for which the slope of trophic level over latitude changed from negative to 
positive varied across ecosystem types.


Generality showed the opposite trend, increasing with latitude for webs with high species richness and decreasing with
latitude for species-poor webs (Fig. \ref{gen_all}).
This increase was driven by a positive interaction between latitude and species richness ($\beta$=0.014, $p$=0.002), as 
the main effect of latitude was negative ($\beta$=-0.018, $p$=0.002). Generality also decreased with species richness 
for estuarine food webs ($\beta$=-0.150, $p$=0.002) but increased with species richness for freshwater, terrestrial, 
and marine webs ($\beta$=0.453, $p$=0.005; $\beta$=0.523, $p$=0.006; and $\beta$=0.675, $p$=0.001; respectively). 
Generality increased with connectance equally in all ecotypes and across all latitudes ($\beta$=0.799, $p$<0.001).


\section*{Discussion}

The tendency of food-web structure to exhibit scaling relationships with both species richness and connectance has been 
well-established \citep{,,,,}. As species richness in particular is also known to vary systematically over latitude 
\citep{,,,,}, intuitively one might suspect that the scaling relationships of other food web properties might also vary
over latitude \citep{}. However, we found that only five of 17 food web properties varied significantly over latitude, 
and that only, of these, only mean and maximum trophi level and generality showed different scaling laws at different latitudes.


The lack of latitudinal gradients in most of the food-web properties considered here may be due to the lack of a 
latitudinal gradient in species richness in this data set. If so, that strongly implies that the latitudinal gradients 
that were observed were driven by some other factor than latitudinal changes in species richness. As we observed 
increasing generality away from 
the equator in conjunction with decreasing trophic level (at least in high-S food webs), it appears that species nearer
the top of the food web may be feeding on a wider variety of prey at the poles, lowering their trophic levels. 
As both feeding on many prey within a trophic level (non-omnivorous generality) \citep{Romanuk2006} and feeding on many 
trophic levels \citep{} have been shown to decrease population variability, high generality at higher latitudes may act 
as ``insurance'' for upper-level consumers by allowing them to switch prey according to availability. 


This contrasts with an earlier study of plant-animal mutualistic networks which found that generality increased in the 
tropics \citep{Schleuning2012}. That increase in generality was attributed to increasing species richness, as high 
resource diversity might lead to generalized consumers \citep{Schleuning2012}. While we also found increasing 
generality with increasing species richness in our dataset, it seems unlikely that higher species richness at the poles 
is driving the observed trend in generality. This suggests that while mutualistic and antagonistic interactions may
be similarly affected by species richness, they respond differently to other latitudinally-associated variables.


[[High TL/low generality in species-poor food webs?]]

% A contrary argument was proposed in an earlier study \citep{Vazquez2004}. In this study, it was noted that bipartite 
% networks such as plant-pollinator and host-parasite networks are typically highly nested (specialists interact with 
% subsets of the interaction partners of generalists), and that nestedness tends to increase with network size 
% \citep{Vazquez2004}. Therefore, as the number of species in a community increases the number of extreme specialists in 
% a community should increase and generality should decrease. Importantly, this argument suggests that latitude can 
% affect generality only indirectly via species richnes. As the networks in our dataset did not increase in size towards 
% the tropics, and there was an effect of latitude as well as species richness, it seems unlikely that either of these 
% two arguments holds.


\section*{Conclusion}

While the overall consistency of scaling laws between species richness and connectance and other food-web properties is 
remarkable, there are nonetheless signification variations in the scaling laws of trophic level and generality. These food web 
properties vary both over latitude and across different network types. [[something punchy]]
