\section*{Abstract}

Several properties of food webs---the networks of feeding links between
species---vary systematically with the species richness of the underlying
community.  Under the ``latitude-niche breadth hypothesis'', which predicts
that species in the tropics will tend to evolve narrower niches, one might
expect that these scaling relationships could also be affected by latitude. To
test this hypothesis, we analysed the scaling relationships between species
richness and average generality, vulnerability, and links per species across a
set of 163 empirical food webs.  We also investigated scaling relationships
between the three food-web properties and the proportions of the web made up
by basal resources, intermediate consumers, and top predators. While we
observed no effect of latitude on scaling relationships with species richness
in the estuarine, marine, and terrestrial food webs, there were strong effects
of latitude on scaling relationships in the freshwater food webs. In these
communities, the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis appears to hold true while
in other habitat types niche breadth appears to vary little. These contrasting
findings indicate that it may be more important to account for habitat than
latitude when exploring gradients in food-web structure.

\section*{Introduction} 

  %Food webs are a thing. (Mention gen, vul, LS.) %Food webs have strong scaling structure.
  Food webs --networks of feeding links between species-- have been used for several decades to summarize the structure of 
  ecological communities~\citep{Petchey2008,Williams2000,Paine1966} and to understand how that structure relates to environmental variables 
  such as habitat type~\citep{Shurin2006,Briand1983}, primary productivity~\citep{Vermaat2009,Thompson2005a,Townsend1998}, and climate~\citep{Baiser2012,Petchey2010}. The latter
  variables in turn have strong gradients over latitude, with productivity and temperature both being higher in the tropics while 
  climate is more variable at high latitudes~\citep{Field1998}. These variables affect both the resources available and species' 
  metabolisms~\citep{Hechinger2011,White2011,OConnor2009,White2007}, and have been proposed as determinants of the strength of 
  interspecific interactions~\citep{Lang2012,Schleuning2012,Schemske2009}. 
  By modulating interactions between species, latitudinal gradients may also shape food-web structure.
  Indeed, these latitudinal environmental gradients have been put forward as potential drivers for the 
  latitudinal gradient in species richness, one of the most general and robust patterns in ecology~\citep{Schemske2009,Macpherson2002,Kaufman1995}.

  % These gradients, together with the strength and generality of associations between biological processes and environmental variables, suggest that variation in network structure 
  % may also be explained by ecological gradients \citep{Baiser2012}. 


  One proposed link between species richness and latitude is the ``latitude-niche breadth hypothesis''~\citep{Vazquez2004}. 
  This hypothesis predicts that decreased seasonality in the tropics should lead to more stable populations, which in
  turn should evolve smaller niches~\citep{Vazquez2004}. These narrow niches should therefore allow more species to 
  coexist in the tropics than at higher latitudes. Alternatively, the higher productivity of the tropics~\citep{Brown2004}
  may result in a broader niche space~\citep{Davies2007} which could also sustain greater biodiversity even if niche 
  sizes are globally similar. Although the assumptions of the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis are only equivocally 
  supported~\citep{Vazquez2004}, it remains a compelling potential mechanism for the latitudinal gradient in species 
  richness~\citep{Lappalainen2006,Krasnov2008,Slove2010}. 


  If the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis is correct, there should also be direct relationships between latitude and the
  degree of specialization (i.e., the breadth of the Eltonian niche ~\citep{Elton1927}) of species within food webs.
  Attempts to unravel these effects, however,
  are complicated by known relationships between species richness and many other network properties~\citep{Riede2010}. 
  For example,
  narrower niches imply fewer links per species (i.e., greater specialization) in the tropics~\citep{Dyer2007,Marra1997}
  but see~\citep{Schleuning2012}). However,
  average numbers of links per species tend to increase in larger food webs~\citep{Dunne2006,Riede2010}. This means
  that a latitudinal effect on specialization may be obscured by a latitudinal gradient in species richness. If this is
  the case, it may still be possible to uncover effects of latitude on specialization by examining the shape of the scaling 
  relationship between specialization and species richness over changing latitude. Here, we use three measures of specialization:
  mean links per species, mean generality (number of prey), and mean vulnerability (number of predators). By testing whether
  latitude affects the scaling of each property with species richness, we test effects of latitude on specialization implied by
  the ``latitude-niche breadth hypothesis''.


\section*{Methods}

  \subsection*{Data Set} 

    We compiled a list of 163 empirical food webs from
    multiple sources (see \emph{Appendix S1} for web origins and selection
    criteria). We recorded study site latitude from the original source where
    possible or, where study sites were described but exact coordinates were not
    given, obtained estimated coordinates using Google Earth~\citep{GoogleEarth}.
    We then divided the species in each web into basal resources (those species with
    consumers but no prey), top predators (those species with prey but no predators),
    and intermediate consumers (species with both predators and prey, including cannibalistic
    species). 


    As the food webs in this dataset are derived from a variety of sources and were compiled over many decades, it
    is likely that they vary in their resolution and in the amount of sampling effort invested in their assembly.
    Many analyses of food-web structure attempt to reduce this variation by aggregating species with identical predator and prey
    sets to form ``trophic species'' webs (e.g.~\citep{Martinez1991,Vermaat2009,Dunne2004,Dunne2013}). As this study
    is concerned directly with the number of species at a particular latitude, however, we did not wish to ignore 
    species with redundant sets of interactions. We therefore analysed both original and trophic-species versions
    of the dataset; in each case using the number of species and 
    links in each web to calculate the mean link density (number of links per species), mean generality 
    (number of prey per species), and mean vulnerability (number of predators per species) of the web. 
    The version of the dataset used did not qualitatively change the results, suggesting that
    the scaling relationships between species richness, other food-web properties, and latitude are very 
    similar whether or not redundant species are included. For simplicity, we present only
    the results for the original webs.


  \subsection*{Scaling Relationships with S}

    The scaling relationships between link density ($Z$) and species richness ($S$)
    has been shown to be a power law~\citep{Riede2010} of the form 

    \begin{equation}
    \label{Power}
    Z_{i} \sim \alpha S_{i}^{\beta}  ,
    \end{equation}

    \noindent which is often re-expressed in logarithmic form 

    \begin{equation}
    \label{Loglog}
    \log{Z_{i}} \sim \log{\alpha} + \beta\log{S_{i}}  .
    \end{equation}

    \noindent As the two forms imply different error distributions, neither of which has strong
    \emph{a priori} justification in our dataset, we followed the recommendations in~\citet{Xiao2011}
    to compare the two model formulations explicitly (see \emph{Appendix S2} for details). 
    The logarithmic form (equation~\ref{Loglog}) provided the better fit to the data,
    as did the logarithmic forms of similar models for the scaling of generality and vulnerability. 
    We therefor used logarithmic models throughout the rest of the study.


  \subsection*{Effect of Latitude on Scaling}

    % Logarithm of a sum is awful:   log(a+c) = log(a) + log(1+b^[log(c)-log(a)]) But can probably feed that into R...

    After determining the appropriate form of the scaling relationship, we
    then assessed the impact of latitude on the scaling relationships between
    species richness and  link density, generality, vulnerability. In the
    context of the scaling relationships above, note  that this implies that
    we aim to determine the effect of latitude on the scaling exponent
    $\beta$. As when examining the relationships between latitude and each
    food  web property directly, we included a categorical variable for
    ecosystem type (stream, lake,  terrestrial, marine, or estuary), as well
    as interactions between food web type and latitude.


    We therefore began by considering models of the form

    \begin{equation}
    \label{PowerLat}
    Z_{i}=\alpha S_{i}^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}L_{i}+\beta_{2}E_{i}+\beta_{3}LE_{i}} + \epsilon_{i} ,
    \end{equation}

    \noindent where $S_{i}$, $L_{i}$, and $E_{i}$ are as defined previously. The logarithmic formulation of this model is

    \begin{equation}
    \label{LogLat}
    \log{Z_{i}} = \log{\alpha}+\beta_{0}\log{S_{i}} + \beta_{1}L\log{S_{i}} +\beta_{2}E\log{S_{i}} +\beta_{3}LE\log{S_{i}} +\epsilon_{i} .
    \end{equation}

    For each property in link density, generality, and vulnerability, we used the form of the equation that was best supported
    when describing the scaling of the property with species richness alone~\citep{Xiao2011}.
    We then simplified each model following the same procedure as for the relationships between
    latitude and food-web properties, except that species richness was retained in all reduced models. 


  \section*{Scaling by Trophic Levels}

    We were also interested in the ways that scaling relationships with species richness might
    be affected by changes to the distribution of species among trophic levels. To
    that end, we repeated all of the above analyses replacing species richness by
    proportion of basal resources, proportion of intermediate consumers,
    or proportion of top predators. All model fitting and model
    simplification procedures were identical to those described for species
    richness.


\section*{Results}

  Link density, generality, and vulnerability each increased with increasing
  species richness (Fig~\ref{props_v_lat}; $\beta_0$=0.666,
  $p$\textless0.001; $\beta_0$=0.623, $p$\textless0.001; and
  $\beta_0$=0.666, $p$\textless0.001 respectively).  For estuarine, marine,
  and terrestrial food webs the strength of this scaling did not vary with
  latitude ($\beta_{Latitude}$=-0.001, $p$=0.267 for link density;
  $\beta_{Latitude}$=-0.001, $p$=0.363 for generality; and
  $\beta_{Latitude}$=-0.001, $p$=0.267 for vulnerability; Fig.~\ref{S}). In
  lake food webs, however, the scaling of each property was stronger towards
  the poles ($\beta_{Latitude:Lake}$=0.005, $p$=0.008;
  $\beta_{Latitude:Lake}$=0.005, $p$=0.002; and
  $\beta_{Latitude:Lake}$=0.005, $p$=0.008, respectively). In stream food
  webs generality increased more rapidly towards the poles
  ($\beta_{Latitude}$=0.007, $p$=0.002) while link density and vulnerability
  did not vary with latitude.


  Unlike species richness, only generality increased with increasing
  proportions of basal resources in a web ($\beta_0$=-0.024, $p$=0.838;
  $\beta_0$=0.333, $p$=0.012; and $\beta_0$=-0.024, $p$=0.839 for link
  density, generality, and vulnerability respectively,
  Fig.~\ref{props_v_lat}). In each case, however, there were substantial
  effects of latitude on the scaling relationships. Thus, the scaling
  exponents for link density and vulnerability were negative for estaurine,
  lake, and stream communities and became more negative towards the poles
  ($\beta_{Latitude}$=-0.007, $p$=0.006 and $\beta_{Latitude}$=-0.007,
  $p$=0.006, respectively; Fig.~\ref{B}). For the scaling of link density and
  vulnerability in marine and terrestrial communities, the overall effect of
  latitude on scaling was positive ($\beta_{Latitude:Marine}$=0.009,
  $p$=0.047; $\beta_{Latitude:Terrestrial}$=0.013, $p$=0.002 and
  $\beta_{Latitude:Marine}$=0.009, $p$=0.047;
  $\beta_{Latitude:Terrestrial}$=0.013, $p$=0.002, respectively) such that
  there was little overall scaling relationship. In contrast, the scaling
  exponent of generality with the proportion of basal resources was positive
  near the equator and negative near the poles in estuarine, lake, and stream
  communities ($\beta_{Latitude}$=-0.009, $p$=0.002) while the scaling
  exponents for marine and terrestrial communities were not significantly
  different from zero ($\beta_{Latitude:Marine}$=0.011, $p$=0.028;
  $\beta_{Latitude:Terrestrial}$=0.015, $p$=0.001; Fig.~\ref{B}).


  As with species richness, link density, generality, and vulnerability
  generally increased with the proportion of intermediate consumers in a web
  ($\beta_0$=1.74, $p$\textless0.001; $\beta_0$=1.92, $p$\textless0.001; and
  $\beta_0$=1.75, $p$\textless0.001 respectively; Fig.~\ref{props_v_lat}).
  The strength of this scaling decreased towards the poles in estuarine,
  lake, marine, and stream communities in each case
  ($\beta_{Latitude}$=-0.012, $p$=0.007; $\beta_{Latitude}$=-0.018,
  $p$\textless0.001; and $\beta_{Latitude}$=-0.012, $p$=0.007, respectively;
  Fig~\ref{I}). In terrestrial communities, however, scaling was stronger
  towards the  poles ($\beta_{Latitude:Terrestrial}$=0.016, $p$=0.023 for
  link density; $\beta_{Latitude:Terrestrial}$=0.022, $p$=0.004 for
  generality; and $\beta_{Latitude:Terrestrial}$=0.016, $p$=0.022 for
  vulnerability, respectively).


  In contrast, link density, generality, and vulnerability decreased as the
  proportion of top predators increased ($\beta_0$=-0.511, $p$\textless0.001;
  $\beta_0$=-0.418, $p$\textless0.001; and $\beta_0$=-0.511, $p$\textless0.001
  respectively; Fig~\ref{props_v_lat}). For estuarine, lake, and marine
  food webs the strength of this scaling did not
  vary significantly with latitude ($\beta_{Latitude}$=-0.001, $p$=0.527 for
  link density; $\beta_{Latitude}$=-0.001, $p$=0.521 for vulnerability; the
  best-fit model for generality did not include any terms for latitude in
  any ecosystem type). In stream and terrestrial food webs, scaling was more
  strongly negative in the tropics and did not differ from zero near the poles,
  although this trend was only significant in streams
  ($\beta_{Latitude:Stream}$=0.015, $p$\textless0.001 and
  $\beta_{Latitude:Terrestrial}$=0.006, $p$=0.069 for link density;
  $\beta_{Latitude:Stream}$=0.015, $p$\textless0.001 and
  $\beta_{Latitude:Terrestrial}$=0.006, $p$=0.067 for vulnerability; Fig~\ref{T}).



\section*{Discussion}

  The tendency of food-web structure to exhibit scaling relationships with
  species richness has been well-established~\citep{Dunne2004,Riede2010}. As
  species richness in particular is also known to vary systematically over
  latitude~\citep{Schemske2009,Macpherson2002,Kaufman1995}, intuitively one
  might suspect that any relationship between food-web properties such as
  generality might be due to the latitudinal gradient in species richness. In
  this dataset, however, we did not find overall latitudinal gradients in
  species richness, links per species,  generality, vulnerability, or the
  proportions of food webs accounted for by  basal resources, intermediate
  consumers, and top predators (see \emph{Appendix S3} for details).


  The lack of a latitudinal gradient in species richness in this dataset contrasts
  strongly with other studies~\citep{Schemske2009,Macpherson2002,Kaufman1995}. As numbers of species and links included in a food web
  vary strongly with sampling effort as well as with the underlying diversity of the study
  area, it is possible that the lack of latitudinal trends here is a result of researchers
  tending to expend similar amounts of sampling effort across studies. This could result in
  food webs describing species-rich tropical communities omitting more species and links
  than species-poor arctic communities. In addition, it is worth noting that gradients in
  species richness are generally measured for a single taxonomic group at a time (e.g.~\citep{Kaufman1995}).
  It is possible that these taxa are not well-represented in our food webs and that the
  dominant taxa in them do not have an underlying latitudinal gradient in richness. 
  In either case, the lack of a strong association between
  species richness and latitude in any ecosystem type
  means that any effect of latitude on other scaling 
  relationships is not being driven by an underlying 
  latitudinal gradient in species richness.
  The lack of confounding effects of latitude allows us to 
  more clearly assess effects of latitude on scaling with 
  species richness and proportions of species in different 
  trophic levels.


  Scaling of links per species, generality, and vulnerability with species
  richness varied strongly across ecosystem types. In estuarine, marine, and
  terrestrial food webs scaling of each property varied little with latitude.
  This is consistent with the idea that species' niche breadths do not vary
  systematically with temperature and productivity but that the niche space
  might be larger in species-rich communities~\citep{Davies2007}. Rather than
  niche space depending on temperature and productivity, it may be that species
  diversity itself affects the niche space available to species (although climate
  may affect speciation rates and therefore the diversity in a region~\citep{Currie2004}). 
  For example, as the plant diversity of a community increases both the 
  variety of food available to herbivores and the structural variety of the habitat will also increase.


  Unlike other ecosystem types, the scaling of generality in lake and stream
  food webs was stronger (i.e.,generality increased more steeply with
  increasing species richness) in higher-latitude food webs.In lake food webs,
  this trend was echoed in the scaling relationships between species richness
  and links per species and vulnerability. This means that species in tropical
  freshwater communities gain fewer additional feeding links per additional
  species in the web and that species in tropical lakes also gain fewer
  predators, and fewer links in general, per additional species than species
  in high-latitude lakes. These trends are consistent with the hypothesis that
  greater stability in the tropics leads to narrower
  niches~\citep{Vazquez2004} and a higher proportion of specialists. This may
  be partly due to high-latitude species tending to switch between different
  seasonally-available prey~\citep{Isaac2012,Wilhelm1999} while tropical
  freshwater ecosystems may have more stable composition.


\section*{Conclusion}

  Our results were inconsistent with the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis in estuarine, marine,
  and terrestrial communities but consistent with the hypothesis of greater specialization
  in the tropics in stream and lake food webs. This suggests that different mechanisms may structure
  food webs in different habitat types and that freshwater food webs in particular may be strongly
  affected by seasonal variation. In addition, different relationships between latitude and niche
  breadth in different habitat types goes some way towards explaining the equivocal support for
  the opposing hypotheses of narrower niches in the tropics~\citep{Vazquez2004} and broader 
  niche space in the tropics~\citep{Davies2007}; both have merit but appear
  to apply to different systems.
