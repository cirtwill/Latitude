\section*{Introduction}

%Food webs are a thing. (Mention gen, vul, LS.) %Food webs have strong scaling structure.
Food webs --networks of feeding links between species-- have been used for over a century to summarize the structure of 
ecological communities \citep{Williams2000,earlierwork} and to understand how that structure relates to environmental variables 
such as land use \citep{Townsend1998,Townsend2004c,Digel2014}, primary productivity \citep{}, and climate\citep{}. The latter
variables in turn have strong gradients over latitude, with productivity and temperature both being higher in the tropics while 
climate is more variable at high latitudes \citep{}, 
suggesting that latitude may indirectly affect food-web structure.
Indeed, these latitudinal environmental gradients have been put forward as potential driverd for the latitudinal gradient in species 
richness, one of the most general and robust patterns in ecology \citep{Schemske2009a,,}.


This effect of latitude on species richness, however, presents a problem for the analysis of other aspects of food-web structure.
Although it was initially thought that food-web structure was small-world and scale invariant \citep{}, further 
analyses with higher-quality data have revealed that most food-web structural properties scale strongly with species 
richness, connectance (the proportion of possible links that are realized), or both \citep{Riede2010} 
(see \citet{Dunne2006} for a review of the history of scaling laws in food web theory). This means that any relationship
between latitude and food-web structure must be considered in light of the latitudinal gradient in species richness.
This is especially true for food-web properties such as measures of specialization
that both scale with species richness \citep{Riede2010} and are related to candidate
explanations for the latitudinal diversity gradient \citep{Vazquez2004}.


[[Smoother transition needed here]]
% Explain niche space hypothesis, Schemske, Vazquez. Then make clear that niche space suggests opposite gradient to ~S^B.
%Then give hypotheses.
A latitudinal gradient in specialization lies behind the ``latitude-niche breadth hypothesis'' \citep{Vazquez2004}.
This hypothesis predicts that decreased seasonality in the tropics should lead to more stable populations, which in
turn should evolve smaller niches \citep{Vazquez2004}. These narrow niches should therefore allow more species to 
coexist in the tropics than can at higher latitudes. Alternatively, higher productivity of the tropics \citep{Brown2004}
may result in a broader niche space \citep{Davies2007} which could also allow greater diversification even if niche 
sizes are globally similar. Although the assumptions of the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis are only equivocably 
supported \citep{Vazquez2004}, it remains a compelling potential mechanism for the latitudinal gradient in species 
richness \citep{Lappalainen2006,Krasnov2008,Slove2010}. 


Importantly, the expectation of the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis that higher species richness is associated with 
reduced competition is contary to the expected increase in the mean number of interactions per species (one potential 
measure of specialization) as species richness increases \citep{Dunne2006,Riede2010}. If, therefore, there is a
distinct effect of latitude on specialization then this effect should be visible in changing scaling relationships.
Here, we tested for changes in the scaling of mean links per species, mean generality, and mean vulnerability with species
richness over latitude. We focused on these three food-web properties --only some of the wide array of metrics that have been
described (see e.g. \citep{})-- because together they provide a measure a species' biotic specialization, which underlies the 
``latitude-niche breadth hypothesis''.


% In addition to species richness, there are general and robust latitudinal gradients in metabolic rates \citep{Stegen2012} and 
% rates and intensities of species interactions \citep{Marquis2005,Schemske2009}. These gradients, together with the strength and 
% generality of associations between biological processes and environmental variables, suggest that variation in network structure 
% may also be explained by ecological gradients \citep{Baiser2012}. Importantly, some of these gradients may act directly 
% on food-web properties such that they change over latitude beyond the expected changes due to changing species richness. For 
% example, if niche sizes vary with latitude then mean numbers of predators, prey, and links per species may also vary with 
% latitude. Some of this variation may be explained by variation in species richness, but as niche sizes are believed to be 
% related directly to latitude it is reasonable to expect that there may also be latitudinal effects unrelated to those of 
% changing species richness.



\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Data Set} 

We compiled a list of 263 empirical food webs from
multiple sources (see Supplemental Information for web origins and selection
criteria). We recorded study site latitude from the original source where
possible or, where study sites were described but exact coordinates were not
given, obtained estimated coordinates using Google Earth \citep{GoogleEarth}.
Webs were also classified according to ecosystem type (terrestrial, lake,
stream, estuary, or marine), year of publication (to control for potential change
in standards of data collection over time \citep{Dunne2006}), and whether or not
humans were included.


% [[list in supplemental (347 GlobalWeb webs \citep{GlobalWeb}), supplemented 
% with 31 food webs used to study the relationship between consumer and resource body sizes (SizeWebs \citep{Brose2006})
% and seven food webs used to study the impact of parasites on network structure (ParWebs \citep{Dunne2013}).
% Of the GlobalWeb webs, 122 were rejected because their original source could not be found or was unpublished (53), they were source or sink
% webs rather than descriptions of an entire community (13), were focused on plant-pollinator, host-parasitoid, or 
% competitive interactions (8, 34, and 2, respectively), described inferred interactions in an extinct community (2), were ``generalized 
% schemes'' rather than being based on empirical observation (8), or because it was not clear which of a variety of 
% described sites the published food web represented (2). (See Table S1 for a list of rejected webs and reasons for their
% exclusion.) For three GlobalWeb webs which included parasites as a minor component of the community, as well as the 
% seven ParWebs webs, we included a modified version of each web which included only free-living species and the 
% interactions between them \citep{Dunne2013}. 


We then converted each web to a trophic-species web by aggregating species with identical predator and prey sets.
Using trophic species webs helps to reduce variation in resolution across different studies and across taxa within
a study \citep{Martinez1991,Vermaat2009,Dunne2004,Dunne2013}. The number of species ($S$) and links ($L$) in each 
trophic species
web were counted and used to calculate mean links per species ($Z$), generality ($G$), and vulnerability ($V$).

\subsection*{Relationships with Latitude}

We first examined simple linear relationships between latitude and $S$, $Z$, $G$, and $V$. We fit models of the form

\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i} = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1} L_{i} + \alpha_{2} E_{i} + \alpha_{3} L_{i} E_{i} + \epsilon_{i} 
\end{eqnarray}

where $S_{i}$ is the species richness of web $i$, $\Lambda_{i}$ its absolute
latitude (degrees north or south  regardless of direction), $E_{i}$ is the
ecosystem type of network $i$ and $\epsilon_{i}$ a residual error term. If the
interaction between latitude and ecosystem type was not significant, this term
was removed and the model re-fit. These simple linear models, fit using the
function lm in R \citep{R} package stats, were used to determine whether there
were latitudinal gradients in food-web structure in this data set.


\subsection*{Scaling Relationships with S}

We were then able to examine the form of the scaling relationship between each property ($Z$, $G$, and $V$) and $S$.
The scaling relationship between $Z$ and $S$ has been shown to be a power law \citep{Riede2010} of the form 

\begin{equation}
\label{Power}
Z_{i}=\alpha S_{i}^{\beta} + \epsilon_{i} 
\end{equation}

which is often re-expreseed in logarithmic form 

\begin{equation}
\label{Loglog}
log(Z_{i}) = log(\alpha) + \beta log(S_{i}) + \epsilon_{i}  
\end{equation}

Although scaling relationships between $S$, $G$, and $V$ have not been explicitly examined (but see scaling 
relationships for the standard devaitions of each property in \citet{Riede2010}), we expect that they will follow
power laws similar to that of the relationship between $S$ and $Z$. This is because the links taken into account in
calculating $G$ and $V$ are subsets of the total links included when calculating $Z$. As with $Z$, we explicitly 
compared the error distributions of models for $G$ and $V$ using both the power-law and logarithmic formulations. 



%%% TO SI

% Note that the two forms of the power-law relationship imply different error structures: normally-distributed, additive error in 
% \ref{Power} and lognormal, multiplicative error in \ref{Loglog}. As there is no intuitive reason to believe that our
% data have one error distribution over another, we follow the recommendations in \citet{Xiao2011} and compared the two
% model formulations explicitly. The model with the error distribution most resembling that observed in the empirical
% data was then used to test for potential effects of latitude.




\subsection*{Effect of Latitude on Scaling}

% Logarithm of a sum is awful:   log(a+c) = log(a) + log(1+b^[log(c)-log(a)]) But can probably feed that into R...


We then assessed
the impact of latitude on this relationship; specifically, the effect of latitude on the scaling exponent $\beta$. 
In addition to latitude, we included a factorial variable for ecosystem type (stream, lake, terrestrial, marine, or estuary) to account for recognized variation in food web structure across ecosystem types \citep{}.
% We also considered other trends in the data that could affect relationships between latitude and species richness.
% To account for changing standards in data collection over time \citep{Dunne2006} we included an effect of year of
% publication. As 11 of our XX webs included humans, and therefore might have different properties than other networks,
% we included a factorial effect of the presence of humans. 
Note that some of our webs describe the same area in different
seasons or different years. 
% [[removed the site-level random effect because I don't want it to steal latitude information.]]


We therefore began by considering models of the form:

\begin{equation}
\label{PowerLat}
Z_{i}=\alpha S_{i}^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}L_{i}+\beta_{3}E_{i}} + \epsilon_{i} 
\end{equation}

where $L_{i}$ is the absolute latitude of food web $i$ (degrees from the equator, regardless of direction),
$E_{i}$ indicates the ecosystem type of food web $i$.


The logarithmic formulation of this model is:

\begin{equation}
\label{LogLat}
1log(Z_{i})= log(\alpha)+\beta_{0}log(S_{i}) + \beta_{1}L*log(S_{i}) +\beta_{3}E*log(S_{i}) +\epsilon_{i}
\end{equation}


We fit equation \ref{LogLat}, as well as similar equations for $G$ and $V$ using R \citep{R} function lm from package stats
\citep{stats}.
We calculated the AIC of the chosen maximal model, as well as the AIC's of a suite of candidate simplified models.
Simplified models were obtained by systematically removing all possible combinations of terms from the full model.
The term for species richness was not removed from a model if any of the terms affecting the exponent $\beta$ were 
included in the model. The best-fitting model was then determined to be the model with the fewest terms where $\delta$AIC<2. 

The model with the lowest AIC was selected as the best-fitting model. 
This simplification was performed using the
R \citep{R} function dredge from package MuMIn \citep{MuMIn}. We then used the R \citep{R} function lm
to estimate the standardized effects ($\beta$s ) for each fixed effect in the 
best-fitting models, as well as their corresponding $p$-values.

% \citep{}. Of these, 302 webs had accessible original sources. 
% 18 source and sink webs, which describe links to or from a focal taxon, were excluded as they are likely 
% to have different food web properties than webs attempting to
% describe the entire community of a site \citep{Williams2002}, as were 8 plant-pollinator, 34 host-parasitoid, and 2 
% competition-focused networks
% \citep{Riede2010}. Of the remaining 230 food webs, we excluded two paleowebs (comprised of probable interactions 
% between extinct or prehistoric species) \citep{Simenstad1978} and five ``generalized schemes'' 
% \citep{Nybakken1982,Percival1929,Swan1961,Landry1977,Petipa1979,Harrison1963}, as 
% we wished to measure
% directly observed rather than inferred interactions. We further excluded a food web aggregated from several sites in 
% the Pacific Ocean which were widely spread in both latitude and longitude and at markedly different successional stages
% \citep{Vinogradov1978}, such that it is not clear which site the food web represents. 
% This left 223 food webs with widely varying levels of taxonomic resolution, 11 of which contained humans. 




\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Scaling Relationships with S and Latitude}

For relationships of $Z$, $G$, and $V$ to S, the assumption of multiplicative log-normal error was better supported
(Table \ref{Errorfits}). We therefore use only models with logarithmic form for the remainder of the paper.


Contrary to expected latitudinal gradients, $S$, $Z$, $G$ and $V$ did not vary significantly over latitude, although $S$ and $G$ did vary over ecosystem types (Table~\ref{Latlms}, Fig.~\ref{Latfigs}).


\subsection*{Effect of Latitude on Scaling with S}

The effect of latitude on scaling relationships varied across ecosystem types
(Table~\ref{Bestfits}, Fig.~\ref{scalingfig}).  In lakes and streams, the
scaling exponent for species richness increased with latitude (although this
increase was not significant for lakes and generality). For other types of
ecosystems, the scaling  exponent for species richness decreased, but not significantly,
with latitude. Despite these overal trends, the observed networks displayed a great deal
of variability in each property. 



\section*{Discussion}

The tendency of food-web structure to exhibit scaling relationships with both
species richness and connectance has been well-established \citep{}. As
species richness in particular is also known to vary systematically over
latitude \citep{}, intuitively one might suspect that any relationship
between food-web properties such as generality might be due to the latitudinal
gradient in species richness. In this dataset, however, we did not find
overall latitudinal gradients in species richness, links per species, 
generality, or vulnerability. This fact notwithstanding, latitude did affect the
scaling relationships between species richness and the other network properties.


The lack of latitudinal gradients in food-web properties in this dataset contrasts
strongly with other studies which have found consistent variation in species richness,
[[other properties]] \citep{}. As numbers of species and links included in a food web
vary strongly with sampling effort as well as with the underlying diversity of the study
area, it is possible that the lack of latitudinal trends here is a result of researchers
tending to expend similar amounts of sampling effort across studies. This could result in
food webs describing species-rich tropical communities omitting more species and links
than species-poor arctic communities. While unusual, the lack of association between species richness
and latitude in any ecosystem type nevertheless means that any effect of latitude on scaling relationships
between species richness and other properties is not being driven by underlying variation in
species richness, allowing us to more clearly assess effects of latitude on scaling.


Our scaling results provide only equivocal support for the niche-breadth hypothesis.
In particular, scaling relationships between species richness and links per species,
generality, or vulnerability strengthened with increasing latitude for lake and stream
food webs but did not vary significantly with latitude in estuarine, terrestrial, and
marine communities. In lakes and streams, the niche hypothesis' proposal that niches
are narrower in the tropics fits the observed scaling patterns. The increase in links
per species as food-web size increases is much slower in low-latitude communities than
in their high-latitude counterparts. From this, we can infer a higher proportion of
specialists with few predators in tropical communities. This echos earlier research [[details]]
\citep{}. In contrast, temperate and polar communities appear to contain more generalist
species. As food webs are generally aggregated over space and time, the stronger
increase in links per species with species richness could be driven by species switching
between more prey species that are only intermittently available in areas with highly
variable climates.
