\section*{Introduction}

%Food webs are a thing. (Mention gen, vul, LS.) %Food webs have strong scaling structure.
Food webs --networks of feeding links between species-- have been used for over a century to summarize the structure of 
ecological communities \citep{Williams2000,earlierwork} and to understand how that structure relates to environmental variables 
such as land use \citep{Townsend1998,Townsend2004c,Digel2014}, primary productivity \citep{}, and climate\citep{}. The latter
variables in turn have strong gradients over latitude, with productivity and temperature both being higher in the tropics while 
climate is more variable at high latitudes \citep{}. These variables affect both the resources available and species' 
metabolisms~\citep{Stegen2012}, and have been proposed as influences on the strength of 
interspecific interactions~\citep{Marquis2005,Schemske2009}. 
By shaping interactions between species, latitudinal gradients may also shape food-web structure.
Indeed, these latitudinal environmental gradients have been put forward as potential driverd for the 
latitudinal gradient in species richness, one of the most general and robust patterns in ecology \citep{Schemske2009a,,}.

% These gradients, together with the strength and generality of associations between biological processes and environmental variables, suggest that variation in network structure 
% may also be explained by ecological gradients \citep{Baiser2012}. 


One proposed link between species richness and latitude is the ``latitude-niche breadth hypothesis''~\citep{,Vazquez2004}. 
This hypothesis predicts that decreased seasonality in the tropics should lead to more stable populations, which in
turn should evolve smaller niches \citep{Vazquez2004}. These narrow niches should therefore allow more species to 
coexist in the tropics than can at higher latitudes. Alternatively, higher productivity of the tropics \citep{Brown2004}
may result in a broader niche space \citep{Davies2007} which could also allow greater diversification even if niche 
sizes are globally similar. Although the assumptions of the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis are only equivocably 
supported \citep{Vazquez2004}, it remains a compelling potential mechanism for the latitudinal gradient in species 
richness \citep{Lappalainen2006,Krasnov2008,Slove2010}. 


If decreased seasonality or higher productivity is the cause of higher species-richness in the tropics, then 
there should be other effects of latitude on food-web structure. Attempts to unravel the effects, however,
are complicated by known effects of species richness on many other network properties~\citep{Riede2010}. In particular,
narrower niches imply fewer links per species (i.e., greater specialization in the tropics~\citep{}). However,
average numbers of links per species tend to increase in larger food webs~\citep{Dunne2006,Riede2010}. This means
that a latitudinal effect on specialization may be obscured by a latitudinal gradient in species richness. If this is
the case, it may still be possible to uncover effects of latitude on specialization by examining the shape of the scaling 
relationship between specialization and species richness over changing latitude. Here, we use three measures of specialization:
mean links per species, mean generality (number of prey), and mean vulnerability (number of predators). By testing whether
latitude affects the scaling of each property with species richness, we test effects of latitude on specialization implied by
the ``latitude-niche breadth hypothesis''.



\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Data Set} 

We compiled a list of 263 empirical food webs from
multiple sources (see Supplemental Information for web origins and selection
criteria). We recorded study site latitude from the original source where
possible or, where study sites were described but exact coordinates were not
given, obtained estimated coordinates using Google Earth \citep{GoogleEarth}.

% [[list in supplemental (347 GlobalWeb webs \citep{GlobalWeb}), supplemented 
% with 31 food webs used to study the relationship between consumer and resource body sizes (SizeWebs \citep{Brose2006})
% and seven food webs used to study the impact of parasites on network structure (ParWebs \citep{Dunne2013}).
% Of the GlobalWeb webs, 122 were rejected because their original source could not be found or was unpublished (53), they were source or sink
% webs rather than descriptions of an entire community (13), were focused on plant-pollinator, host-parasitoid, or 
% competitive interactions (8, 34, and 2, respectively), described inferred interactions in an extinct community (2), were ``generalized 
% schemes'' rather than being based on empirical observation (8), or because it was not clear which of a variety of 
% described sites the published food web represented (2). (See Table S1 for a list of rejected webs and reasons for their
% exclusion.) For three GlobalWeb webs which included parasites as a minor component of the community, as well as the 
% seven ParWebs webs, we included a modified version of each web which included only free-living species and the 
% interactions between them \citep{Dunne2013}. 


As the food webs in this dataset are derived from a variety of sources and were compiled over many decades, it
is likely that they vary in their resolution and in the amount of sampling effort invested in their assembly.
Many analyses of food-web structure reduce this variation by aggregating species with identical predator and prey
sets to form ``trophic species'' webs (e.g. ~\citep{Martinez1991,Vermaat2009,Dunne2004,Dunne2013}). As this study
is concerned directly with the number of species at a particular latitude, however, we did not wish to ignore 
species with redundant sets of interactions. We therefore analysed both original and trophic-species versions
of the dataset. As the version of the dataset used did not qualitatively change the results, we present only
the results for the original webs in the main text. In each case, we counted the number of species ($S$) and 
links in each web and used these to calculate the mean number of links per species ($Z$), mean generality 
($G$), and mean vulnerability ($V$) of each web. 


\subsection*{Relationships with Latitude}

[[re-run with dredge]]
To determine whether there were latitudinal gradients in food-web structure,
we first examined simple linear relationships between latitude and $S$, $Z$, $G$, and $V$. 
We fit models of the form

\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i} = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1} L_{i} + \alpha_{2} E_{i} + \alpha_{3} L_{i} E_{i} + \epsilon_{i} 
\end{eqnarray}

where $S_{i}$ is the species richness of web $i$, $L_{i}$ its absolute
latitude (degrees north or south  regardless of direction), $E_{i}$ is the
ecosystem type of network $i$ (comprising terms for stream, marine, lake, and terrestrial networks with estuarine
networks being the intercept) and $\epsilon_{i}$ a residual error term. 
We then simplified these maximal models. To do this, we calculated the AIC
of the chosen maximal model, as well as the AIC's of a suite of candidate simplified models identified
using R~\citep{R} function dredge from packages MuMIn~\citep{MuMIn}. Simplified models were obtained by
systematically removing all possible combinations of terms from the full model.
The best-fitting model was then determined to be the model with the fewest terms where $\delta$AIC<2. 


\subsection*{Scaling Relationships with S}

Next, we examined the form of the scaling relationship between each 
property ($Z$, $G$, and $V$) and $S$. The scaling relationship between $Z$ and 
$S$ has been shown to be a power law \citep{Riede2010} of the form 

\begin{equation}
\label{Power}
Z_{i}~\alpha S_{i}^{\beta}
\end{equation}

which is often re-expreseed in logarithmic form 

\begin{equation}
\label{Loglog}
\log{Z_{i}} ~ \log{\alpha} + \beta\log{S_{i}}
\end{equation}


Although these relationships are very similar, they imply different error distributions~\citep{Xiao2011}.
Specifically,~\ref{Power} implies a normally-distributed, additive error and~\ref{LogLog} a lognormal,
multiplicative error. As we have no \emph{a priori} reason to believe that our dataset has one error distribution
over another, we follow the recommendations in \citet{Xiao2011} and compared the two
model formulations explicitly. The model with the error distribution most resembling that observed in the empirical
data was then used to test for potential effects of latitude.


Although scaling relationships between $S$, $G$, and $V$ have not been explicitly examined (but see scaling 
relationships for the standard devaitions of each property in \citet{Riede2010}), we expect that they will follow
power laws similar to that of the relationship between $S$ and $Z$. This is because the links taken into account in
calculating $G$ and $V$ are subsets of the total links included when calculating $Z$. As with $Z$, we explicitly 
compared the error distributions of models for $G$ and $V$ using both the power-law and logarithmic formulations. 
In each case, we used the best-fitting equation as a template when assessing the effect of latitude on scaling with
species richness.



\subsection*{Effect of Latitude on Scaling}

% Logarithm of a sum is awful:   log(a+c) = log(a) + log(1+b^[log(c)-log(a)]) But can probably feed that into R...


We then assessed
the impact of latitude on this relationship; specifically, the effect of latitude on the scaling exponent $\beta$. 
In addition to latitude, we included a factorial variable for ecosystem type (stream, lake, terrestrial, marine, or estuary) to account for recognized variation in food web structure across ecosystem types \citep{}.
% We also considered other trends in the data that could affect relationships between latitude and species richness.
% To account for changing standards in data collection over time \citep{Dunne2006} we included an effect of year of
% publication. As 11 of our XX webs included humans, and therefore might have different properties than other networks,
% we included a factorial effect of the presence of humans. 
Note that some of our webs describe the same area in different
seasons or different years. 
% [[removed the site-level random effect because I don't want it to steal latitude information.]]


We therefore began by considering models of the form:

\begin{equation}
\label{PowerLat}
Z_{i}=\alpha S_{i}^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}L_{i}+\beta_{3}E_{i}} + \epsilon_{i} 
\end{equation}

where $L_{i}$ is the absolute latitude of food web $i$ (degrees from the equator, regardless of direction),
$E_{i}$ indicates the ecosystem type of food web $i$.


The logarithmic formulation of this model is:

\begin{equation}
\label{LogLat}
1log(Z_{i})= log(\alpha)+\beta_{0}log(S_{i}) + \beta_{1}L*log(S_{i}) +\beta_{3}E*log(S_{i}) +\epsilon_{i}
\end{equation}


We fit equation \ref{LogLat}, as well as similar equations for $G$ and $V$ using R \citep{R} function lm from package stats
\citep{stats}.
We calculated the AIC of the chosen maximal model, as well as the AIC's of a suite of candidate simplified models.
Simplified models were obtained by systematically removing all possible combinations of terms from the full model.
The term for species richness was not removed from a model if any of the terms affecting the exponent $\beta$ were 
included in the model. The best-fitting model was then determined to be the model with the fewest terms where $\delta$AIC<2. 

The model with the lowest AIC was selected as the best-fitting model. 
This simplification was performed using the
R \citep{R} function dredge from package MuMIn \citep{MuMIn}. We then used the R \citep{R} function lm
to estimate the standardized effects ($\beta$s ) for each fixed effect in the 
best-fitting models, as well as their corresponding $p$-values. 



% of  the University of Canberra's GlobalWeb database (www.globalwebdb.com) 
% \citep{}. Of these, 302 webs had accessible original sources. 
% 18 source and sink webs, which describe links to or from a focal taxon, were excluded as they are likely 
% to have different food web properties than webs attempting to
% describe the entire community of a site \citep{Williams2002}, as were 8 plant-pollinator, 34 host-parasitoid, and 2 
% competition-focused networks
% \citep{Riede2010}. Of the remaining 230 food webs, we excluded two paleowebs (comprised of probable interactions 
% between extinct or prehistoric species) \citep{Simenstad1978} and five ``generalized schemes'' 
% \citep{Nybakken1982,Percival1929,Swan1961,Landry1977,Petipa1979,Harrison1963}, as 
% we wished to measure
% directly observed rather than inferred interactions. We further excluded a food web aggregated from several sites in 
% the Pacific Ocean which were widely spread in both latitude and longitude and at markedly different successional stages
% \citep{Vinogradov1978}, such that it is not clear which site the food web represents. 
% This left 223 food webs with widely varying levels of taxonomic resolution, 11 of which contained humans. 




\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Scaling Relationships with S and Latitude}

For relationships of $Z$, $G$, and $V$ to S, the assumption of multiplicative log-normal error was better supported
(Table \ref{Errorfits}). We therefore use only models with logarithmic form for the remainder of the paper.


Contrary to expected latitudinal gradients, $S$, $Z$, $G$ and $V$ did not vary significantly over latitude, although $S$ and $G$ did vary over ecosystem types (Table~\ref{Latlms}, Fig.~\ref{Latfigs}).


\subsection*{Effect of Latitude on Scaling with S}

The effect of latitude on scaling relationships varied across ecosystem types
(Table~\ref{Bestfits}, Fig.~\ref{scalingfig}).  In lakes and streams, the
scaling exponent for species richness increased with latitude (although this
increase was not significant for lakes and generality). For other types of
ecosystems, the scaling  exponent for species richness decreased, but not significantly,
with latitude. Despite these overal trends, the observed networks displayed a great deal
of variability in each property. 



\section*{Discussion}

The tendency of food-web structure to exhibit scaling relationships with both
species richness and connectance has been well-established \citep{}. As
species richness in particular is also known to vary systematically over
latitude \citep{}, intuitively one might suspect that any relationship
between food-web properties such as generality might be due to the latitudinal
gradient in species richness. In this dataset, however, we did not find
overall latitudinal gradients in species richness, links per species, 
generality, or vulnerability. This fact notwithstanding, latitude did affect the
scaling relationships between species richness and the other network properties.


The lack of latitudinal gradients in food-web properties in this dataset contrasts
strongly with other studies which have found consistent variation in species richness,
[[other properties]] \citep{}. As numbers of species and links included in a food web
vary strongly with sampling effort as well as with the underlying diversity of the study
area, it is possible that the lack of latitudinal trends here is a result of researchers
tending to expend similar amounts of sampling effort across studies. This could result in
food webs describing species-rich tropical communities omitting more species and links
than species-poor arctic communities. While unusual, the lack of association between species richness
and latitude in any ecosystem type nevertheless means that any effect of latitude on scaling relationships
between species richness and other properties is not being driven by underlying variation in
species richness, allowing us to more clearly assess effects of latitude on scaling.


Our scaling results provide only equivocal support for the niche-breadth hypothesis.
In particular, scaling relationships between species richness and links per species,
generality, or vulnerability strengthened with increasing latitude for lake and stream
food webs but did not vary significantly with latitude in estuarine, terrestrial, and
marine communities. In lakes and streams, the niche hypothesis' proposal that niches
are narrower in the tropics fits the observed scaling patterns. The increase in links
per species as food-web size increases is much slower in low-latitude communities than
in their high-latitude counterparts. From this, we can infer a higher proportion of
specialists with few predators in tropical communities. This echos earlier research [[details]]
\citep{}. In contrast, temperate and polar communities appear to contain more generalist
species. As food webs are generally aggregated over space and time, the stronger
increase in links per species with species richness could be driven by species switching
between more prey species that are only intermittently available in areas with highly
variable climates.
