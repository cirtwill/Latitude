\section*{Introduction} [[Add something about ecosystem type since it's in the methods]]

%Food webs are a thing. (Mention gen, vul, LS.) %Food webs have strong scaling structure.
Food webs --networks of feeding links between species-- have been used for over a century to summarize the structure of 
ecological communities \citep{Williams2000,earlierwork} and to understand how that structure relates to environmental variables 
such as land use [[lets really consider the three env variables used here. there really is not a lot of work on land use....i get why prim prod and climate are included....maybe focus on habitat types since you focus on habitats in the analysis]] \citep{Townsend1998,Townsend2004c,Digel2014}, primary productivity \citep{}, and climate\citep{}. The latter
variables in turn have strong gradients over latitude, with productivity and temperature both being higher in the tropics while 
climate is more variable at high latitudes \citep{}. [[maybe climatic regimes? the issue is that there really are not a lot of studies that look at these things.....]] These variables affect both the resources available and species' 
metabolisms~\citep{Stegen2012}, and have been proposed as determinants of the strength of 
interspecific interactions~\citep{Marquis2005,Schemske2009}. 
By modulating interactions between species, latitudinal gradients may also shape food-web structure.
Indeed, these latitudinal environmental gradients have been put forward as potential drivers for the 
latitudinal gradient in species richness, one of the most general and robust patterns in ecology \citep{Schemske2009a,,}.

% These gradients, together with the strength and generality of associations between biological processes and environmental variables, suggest that variation in network structure 
% may also be explained by ecological gradients \citep{Baiser2012}. 


One proposed link between species richness and latitude is the ``latitude-niche breadth hypothesis''~\citep{,Vazquez2004}. 
This hypothesis predicts that decreased seasonality in the tropics should lead to more stable populations, which in
turn should evolve smaller niches \citep{Vazquez2004}. These narrow niches should therefore allow more species to 
coexist in the tropics than at higher latitudes. Alternatively, higher productivity of the tropics \citep{Brown2004}
may result in a broader niche space \citep{Davies2007} which could also allow greater diversification even if niche 
sizes are globally similar. Although the assumptions of the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis are only equivocably 
supported \citep{Vazquez2004}, it remains a compelling potential mechanism for the latitudinal gradient in species 
richness \citep{Lappalainen2006,Krasnov2008,Slove2010}. 


If decreased seasonality or higher productivity is the cause of higher species-richness in the tropics, then 
there should be other effects of latitudinal gradients on food-web structure. Attempts to unravel these effects, however,
are complicated by known relationships between species richness and many other network properties~\citep{Riede2010}[[Check that I don't say that richness causes structural effects elsewhere]]. In particular,
narrower niches imply fewer links per species (i.e., greater specialization in the tropics~\citep{}). However,
average numbers of links per species tend to increase in larger food webs~\citep{Dunne2006,Riede2010}. This means
that a latitudinal effect on specialization may be obscured by a latitudinal gradient in species richness. If this is
the case, it may still be possible to uncover effects of latitude on specialization by examining the shape of the scaling 
relationship between specialization and species richness over changing latitude. Here, we use three measures of specialization:
mean links per species, mean generality (number of prey), and mean vulnerability (number of predators). By testing whether
latitude affects the scaling of each property with species richness, we test effects of latitude on specialization implied by
the ``latitude-niche breadth hypothesis''.



\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Data Set} 

We compiled a list of 263 empirical food webs from
multiple sources (see Supplemental Information for web origins and selection
criteria). We recorded study site latitude from the original source where
possible or, where study sites were described but exact coordinates were not
given, obtained estimated coordinates using Google Earth \citep{GoogleEarth}.
We then divided the species in each web into basal resources (those species with
consumers but no prey), top predators (those species with prey but no predators),
and intermediate consumers (species with both predators and prey, including cannibalistic
species). For our future analyses, we considered only those webs with at least one basal
resource, one intermediate consumer, and one top predator. This reduced our dataset to
163 food webs.

% [[list in supplemental (347 GlobalWeb webs \citep{GlobalWeb}), supplemented 
% with 31 food webs used to study the relationship between consumer and resource body sizes (SizeWebs \citep{Brose2006})
% and seven food webs used to study the impact of parasites on network structure (ParWebs \citep{Dunne2013}).
% Of the GlobalWeb webs, 122 were rejected because their original source could not be found or was unpublished (53), they were source or sink
% webs rather than descriptions of an entire community (13), were focused on plant-pollinator, host-parasitoid, or 
% competitive interactions (8, 34, and 2, respectively), described inferred interactions in an extinct community (2), were ``generalized 
% schemes'' rather than being based on empirical observation (8), or because it was not clear which of a variety of 
% described sites the published food web represented (2). (See Table S1 for a list of rejected webs and reasons for their
% exclusion.) For three GlobalWeb webs which included parasites as a minor component of the community, as well as the 
% seven ParWebs webs, we included a modified version of each web which included only free-living species and the 
% interactions between them \citep{Dunne2013}. 


As the food webs in this dataset are derived from a variety of sources and were compiled over many decades, it
is likely that they vary in their resolution and in the amount of sampling effort invested in their assembly.
Many analyses of food-web structure reduce this variation by aggregating species with identical predator and prey
sets to form ``trophic species'' webs (e.g. ~\citep{Martinez1991,Vermaat2009,Dunne2004,Dunne2013}). As this study
is concerned directly with the number of species at a particular latitude, however, we did not wish to ignore 
species with redundant sets of interactions. We therefore analysed both original and trophic-species versions
of the dataset. As the version of the dataset used did not qualitatively change the results, we present only
the results for the original webs in the main text. [[so what does this suggest? i find that in methods when making these statements it helps to go the step beyond and try and infer why trophic species/SR yielded similar results]] In each case, we counted the number of species ($S$) and 
links in each web and used these to calculate the mean number of links per species ($Z$), mean generality 
($G$), and mean vulnerability ($V$) of each web. 


\subsection*{Relationships with Latitude}

To determine whether there were latitudinal gradients in food-web structure,
we first examined simple linear relationships between latitude and $S$, $Z$, $G$, and $V$. 
We fit models of the form

\begin{equation}
\label{Latfull}
S_{i} = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1} L_{i} + \alpha_{2} E_{i} + \alpha_{3} L_{i} E_{i} + \epsilon_{i} 
\end{equation}

where $S_{i}$ is the species richness of web $i$, $L_{i}$ its absolute
latitude (degrees north or south  regardless of direction), $E_{i}$ is the
ecosystem type of network $i$ (comprising terms for stream, marine, lake, and terrestrial networks with estuarine
networks being the intercept) and $\epsilon_{i}$ a residual error term. 
We then simplified these maximal models. To do this, we calculated the AIC
of the chosen maximal model, as well as the AIC's of a suite of candidate simplified models identified
using R~\citep{R} function dredge from packages MuMIn~\citep{MuMIn}. Simplified models were obtained by
systematically removing all possible combinations of terms from the full model.
The best-fitting model was then determined to be the model with the fewest terms 
where $\Delta$AIC\textless2. If several models shared the fewest number of terms 
and had $\Delta$AIC\textless2, the model with the lowest AIC in that set was chosen as the best-fit
model.


\subsection*{Scaling Relationships with S}

Next, we examined the form of the scaling relationship between each 
property ($Z$, $G$, and $V$) and $S$. The scaling relationship between $Z$ and 
$S$ has been shown to be a power law \citep{Riede2010} of the form 

\begin{equation}
\label{Power}
Z_{i}~\alpha S_{i}^{\beta}
\end{equation}

which is often re-expreseed in logarithmic form 

\begin{equation}
\label{Loglog}
\log{Z_{i}} ~ \log{\alpha} + \beta\log{S_{i}}
\end{equation}


Although these relationships are very similar, they imply different error distributions~\citep{Xiao2011}.
Specifically,~\ref{Power} implies a normally-distributed, additive error and~\ref{Loglog} a lognormal,
multiplicative error. As we have no \emph{a priori} reason to believe that our dataset has one error distribution
over another, we follow the recommendations in \citet{Xiao2011} and compared the two
model formulations explicitly. The model with the error distribution most resembling that observed in the empirical
data was then used to test for potential effects of latitude.


Although scaling relationships between $S$, $G$, and $V$ have not been explicitly examined (but see scaling 
relationships for the standard devaitions of each property in \citet{Riede2010}), we expect that they will follow
power laws similar to that of the relationship between $S$ and $Z$. This is because the links taken into account in
calculating $G$ and $V$ are subsets of the total links included when calculating $Z$. As with $Z$, we explicitly 
compared the error distributions of models for $G$ and $V$ using both the power-law and logarithmic formulations. 
In each case, we used the best-fitting equation as a template when assessing the effect of latitude on scaling with
species richness.



\subsection*{Effect of Latitude on Scaling}

% Logarithm of a sum is awful:   log(a+c) = log(a) + log(1+b^[log(c)-log(a)]) But can probably feed that into R...


We then assessed the impact of latitude on the scaling relationships between $Z$, $G$, $V$, and $S$. 
Even if there is no direct effect of latitude on specialization, perhaps due to contrasting effects
on species richness as described above, there may still be an effect of latitude on the scaling of
each property with species richness. In fact, if the species-rich tropics truly have narrower 
niches~\citep{Brown2004}, then we would expect to see less increase in mean numbers of links, 
predators, and prey with increasing species richness in the tropics.
In the context of the scaling relationships above, we wish to determine the effect of latitude on
the scaling exponent $\beta$. As when examining the relationships between latitude and each food 
web property directly, we included a factorial variable for ecosystem type (stream, lake, 
terrestrial, marine, or estuary), as well as interactions between food web type and latitude.


We therefore began by considering models of the form:

\begin{equation}
\label{PowerLat}
Z_{i}=\alpha S_{i}^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}L_{i}+\beta_{2}E_{i}+\beta_{3}LE_{i}} + \epsilon_{i} 
\end{equation}

where $S_{i}$ is the number of species in food web $i$, $L_{i}$ is the absolute latitude of food web $i$ (degrees from the equator, regardless of direction),
$E_{i}$ indicates the ecosystem type of food web $i$.


The logarithmic formulation of this model is:

\begin{equation}
\label{LogLat}
\log{Z_{i}} = \log{\alpha}+\beta_{0}\log{S_{i}} + \beta_{1}L\log{S_{i}} +\beta_{2}E\log{S_{i}} +\beta_{3}LE\log{S_{i}} +\epsilon_{i}
\end{equation}

For each property in $Z$, $G$, and $V$, we used the form of the equation that was best supported
when describing the scaling of the property with species richness alone~\citep{Xiao2011}.
We then simplified the model. As with the models describing the relationships between latitude and food-web
properties, we calculated the AIC of the maximal and all reduced models, created by systematically removing
all possible combinations of terms. Note that if an interaction term was included in a reduced model, all
associated main effects were also retained. $S$ was included in all reduced models. Reduced models were
identified using the R~\citep{R} function dredge from package MuMIn~\citep{MuMIn}. The best-fitting model
was then determined to be the model with the fewest terms where $\Delta$AIC\textless2. Where there were several
models with the fewest terms where $\Delta$AIC\textless2, the model with the lowest AIC in this set was chosen as
the best-fitting model. The best-fitting model was then fit using R~\citep{R} function lm from package stats~\citep{stats}.

% \citep{}. Of these, 302 webs had accessible original sources. 
% 18 source and sink webs, which describe links to or from a focal taxon, were excluded as they are likely 
% to have different food web properties than webs attempting to
% describe the entire community of a site \citep{Williams2002}, as were 8 plant-pollinator, 34 host-parasitoid, and 2 
% competition-focused networks
% \citep{Riede2010}. Of the remaining 230 food webs, we excluded two paleowebs (comprised of probable interactions 
% between extinct or prehistoric species) \citep{Simenstad1978} and five ``generalized schemes'' 
% \citep{Nybakken1982,Percival1929,Swan1961,Landry1977,Petipa1979,Harrison1963}, as 
% we wished to measure
% directly observed rather than inferred interactions. We further excluded a food web aggregated from several sites in 
% the Pacific Ocean which were widely spread in both latitude and longitude and at markedly different successional stages
% \citep{Vinogradov1978}, such that it is not clear which site the food web represents. 
% This left 223 food webs with widely varying levels of taxonomic resolution, 11 of which contained humans. 


\section*{Scaling by Trophic Levels}

We were also interested in the ways that scaling relationships with $S$ might
be affected by changes to the distribution of species among trophic levels. To
that end, we repeated all of the above analyses replacing species richness by
proportion of basal resources $B$, proportion of intermediate consumers $I$,
and  proportion of top predators $T$ in turn. All model fitting and model
simplification procedures were identical to those described for species-
richness.



\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Scaling Relationships with $S$ and Latitude}

  For relationships of $Z$, $G$, $V$, $B$, $I$, and $T$ to $S$, equation~\ref{Loglog} had a
  lower AIC than the corresponding equation~\ref{Power}. This indicates that the
  data support an assumption of multiplicative log-normal error better than an
  assumption of additive normal error. That is, models where $\epsilon$ is
  modelled as an exponent to a multiplicative term (that is, an additive term on
  the logarithmic scale) provide a better description of the data than models
  where $\epsilon$ is modelled as an additive term on the arithmetic scale
  [[That's what this means... not sure if explaining it actually adds anything
  though]] .  We therefore used logarithmic-form models when assessing the
  effect of latitude on scaling relationships  with $S$.


  Contrary to the expected latitudinal gradient, the best-fit version of
  equation~\ref{Latfull} for $S$ included a signficant effect of latitude on $S$
  in stream webs only ($\alpha_{Latitude:Stream}$=-1.69, $p$=0.007).  This
  relationship was robust to the removal of three outliers (post-removal
  $\alpha_{Latitude:Stream}$=-1.17, $p$=0.038). The best-fit versions of
  equation~\ref{Latfull} for $Z$ and $V$ also included relatioships with
  latitude in stream webs ($\alpha_{Latitude:Stream}$=-0.179, $p$=0.007 and
  $\alpha_{Latitude:Stream}$=-0.179, $p$=0.007, respectively). However, after
  the removal of three outlying stream webs with very high $Z$ and $V$ (two of
  which also had unusually high $S$) these relationships were no longer
  significant ($\alpha_{Latitude:Stream}$=-0-0.046, $p$=0.373 and
  $\alpha_{Latitude:Stream}$=-0.046, $p$=0.373, respectively). The best-fit
  version of equation~\ref{Latfull} for $G$ did not include any effect of
  latitude in any ecosystem type. Marine food webs
  had lower $S$, $Z$, $G$, and $V$ than all other web types (post-removal
  $\alpha_{Marine}$=-29.5, $p$\textless0.001, $\alpha_{Marine}$=-1.46,
  $p$=0.035, $\alpha_{Marine}$=-1.74, $p$=0.0612, and $\alpha_{Marine}$=-1.46,
  $p$=0.035, respectively) while stream food webs had higher $G$ than webs from
  other ecosystem types (post-removal $\alpha_{Stream}$=3.51,
  $p$\textless0.001) [[Check streams in $V$, $Z$ for post-removal models]].


  The relationships between $B$, $I$, and $T$ with latitude were broadly similar
  to the relationship between $S$ and latitude. $B$ did not vary significantly
  over latitude except in stream food webs where $B$ increased towards the poles
  ($\alpha_{Latitude:Stream}$=0.012, $p$\textless0.001), while $I$ did not vary
  significantly with latitude in any ecosystem type. Like $S$, $T$ decreased
  towards the poles in stream food webs ($\alpha_{Latitude}$=0.001, $p$=0.136;
  $\alpha_{Latitude:Stream}$=-0.006, $p$=0.030) and also decreased towards the
  poles in lake webs ($\alpha_{Latitude:Lake}$=-0.006, $p$=0.001
  All of these trends were robust to the removal of outliers.


\subsection*{Effect of Latitude on Scaling with S, B, I, and T}

$Z$, $G$, and $V$ all increased with increasing $S$ at all latitudes. The strength of
this increase varied both over latitude and across ecosystem types. For $Z$,
scaling was stronger towards the equator in estuarine, marine, stream, and
terrestrial ecosystems (). In lake ecosystems, however, scaling was stronger
toward the poles. $G$ and $V$ followed the same trends, except that scaling of $G$
with $S$ was stronger towards the poles as in lakes ().


When considering the proportion of $S$ accounted for by different trophic
levels, however, the scaling relationships with $Z$, $G$, and $V$ were more
complex. While $Z$ increased with increasing $I$ as well as with increasing
$S$, $Z$ tended to decrease with increasing $B$ and $T$. The decrease of $Z$
with $B$ was stronger towards the poles in estuarine, lake, and stream webs
(), varied little over latitude in marine webs (), and was stronger towards
the poles in terrestrial webs (). The best-fitting model for the relationship
of $Z$ and $I$ did not include any terms for variation in scaling across
latitude for any ecosystem type. Similar to the scaling of $Z$ with $B$, the
decrease in $Z$ with increasing $T$ was stronger towards the poles in
estuarine, lake, and marine webs, although the influence of latitude was
weaker than with $B$ (). Again like the relationship between $Z$ and $B$,
scaling of $Z$ with $T$ was stronger towards the equator in terrestrial webs.
Unlike in the relationship between $Z$ and $B$, however, scaling of $Z$ with
$T$ was also stronger towards the equator in stream webs.


As with $Z$, $G$ tended to decrease with increasing $B$ and $T$ and increase
with increasing $I$. Once again, however, these trends varied with latitude
and ecosystem type. The decline of G with increasing S was strongest at the
poles in estaurine, lake, and marine ecosystems; in each ecosystem type $G$
increased slightly with $B$ in equatorial webs. In marine webs $G$ increased
slightly with $B$ at all latitudes and in terrestrial webs $G$ increased with
$B$ in high-latitude webs but decreased slightly with $B$ at the equator. The
strength of the increase in $G$ with $I$ varied little with latitude except in
stream webs, where the increase was strongest towards the equator and $G$
decreased with $I$ in arctic food webs. The best-fitting model for the scaling
of $G$ with $T$ did not include any terrms for latitude in any ecosystem type.


$V$ too generally decreased with increasing $B$ and $T$ while increasing with
$I$. Similar to $G$, the decline of $V$ with increasing $B$ was strongest
towards the poles in estuarine, lake, and stream webs, varied little with
latitude in marine webs, and was strongest towards the equator in terrestrial
food webs. As with $Z$, the best-fit model for the scaling of $V$ with $I$ did
not include any terms for latitude in any ecosystem type. Scaling of $V$ with
$T$ was also simmilar to the pattern for $Z$, with sharper decreases in $V$
towards the poles in estuarine, lake, and marine webs and stronger towards the
equator in terrestrial and stream webs.



\section*{Discussion}

The tendency of food-web structure to exhibit scaling relationships with
species richness has been well-established \citep{Dunne2004,Riede2010}. As
species richness in particular is also known to vary systematically over
latitude \citep{}, intuitively one might suspect that any relationship
between food-web properties such as generality might be due to the latitudinal
gradient in species richness. In this dataset, however, we did not find
overall latitudinal gradients in species richness, links per species, 
generality, vulnerability, or the proportions of food webs accounted for by 
basal resources, intermediate consumers, and top predators. 


The lack of latitudinal gradients in food-web properties in this dataset contrasts
strongly with other studies which have found consistent variation in species richness,
[[other properties]] \citep{}. As numbers of species and links included in a food web
vary strongly with sampling effort as well as with the underlying diversity of the study
area, it is possible that the lack of latitudinal trends here is a result of researchers
tending to expend similar amounts of sampling effort across studies. This could result in
food webs describing species-rich tropical communities omitting more species and links
than species-poor arctic communities. In addition, it is worth noting that gradients in
species richness are generally measured for a single taxonomic group at a time~\citep{}.
It is possible that these taxa are not well-represented in our food webs and that the
dominant taxa in them do not have an underlying latitudinal gradient in richness. In
either case, the lack of association between species richness
and latitude in any ecosystem type nevertheless means that any effect of latitude on scaling relationships
between species richness and other properties is not being driven by underlying variation in
species richness, allowing us to more clearly assess effects of latitude on scaling with 
species richness and proportions of species in different trophic levels.


Scaling of links per species, generality, and vulnerability with species
richness varied strongly across ecosystem types. In estuarine, marine, and
terrestrial food webs scaling of each property varied little with latitude.
This is consistent with the idea that species' niche breadths do not vary
systematically with temperature and productivity but that the niche space
might be larger in species-rich communities~\citep{Davies2007}. In lake food
webs, in contrast, scaling of each property was much stronger in high-latitude
food webs. In stream food webs, scaling of links per species and vulnerability
varied little over latitude while scaling of generality was stronger in high-
latitude food webs. This means that species in trophical freshwater
communities gain fewer additional feeding links per additional species in the
web and is consistent with the hypothesis that greater stability in the
tropics leads to narrower niches~\citep{Brown2004} and a higher proportion of
specialists~\citep{}.


In lake food webs, species in tropical food webs also gained fewer predators,
and therefore fewer links overall. Conversely, for species in high-latitude
food webs numbers of predators, prey, and links per species all increased
rapidly with increasing species richness. This may reflect prey switching as
different food sources become available in different seasons~\citep{}.
Alternatively, the sharper increases in links per species, generality, and
vulnerability at higher latitudes may be driven by the relationships between
each property and the proportion of basal resources in these food webs.
[[Except each property increases more with S and decreases more with B...]]


Surprisingly species in high-latitude stream food webs, while gaining many
additional prey species per additional species in the food web, did not
receive any more predators or links than species in low-latitude streams. The
limited influence of latitude on the scaling relationships of links per
species and vulnerability may be because, for these properties, latitude had
opposite effects on the scaling relationships with proportions of basal
resources and top predators. When considering generality, however, only the
proportion of basal resources varied significantly over latitude. [[Same
problem as in lakes, the trends are opposite.]]


\section*{Conclusion}

% Our results were consistent with the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis, but only in certain ecosystem
% types. This suggests that different types of food webs respond differently to differences in climate
% driven by latitudinal gradients. [[A sentence or two explaining why this is important.]]
