Data manipulation:

food_web_properties.py - takes in food webs, calculates properties, makes R file

listcreator.py - turns matrix webs into list webs


Modelling:

Models. R - includes prefab code to decide whether lognormal or normal error is best, plus my models.


Figure creation:


Looks like property_plots so far.


Data files:

mod_data/summary-properties.tsv - values of food-web properties for each web

It turns out that 9 webs had inaccurate headers and 1 (WEB294) was flipped. Updated property file with these webs corrected, mean SWTL and mean shortest parth is mod_data/summary-properties_extended_connected.tsv
